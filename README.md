## Desktop-Assistant

# About
This program is a personal project designed to crete a voice activated desktop assistant to help open applications, webpages and more.

# Roadmap
I Plan on adding features to allow the program to run in the background as well as expand the capabilities of it.

# How to use
To start with, after downloading the files, make sure to activate the vitual environment in whatever IDE it is that you are using. 
Then make sure to download all the modules that are imported at the top of the main file. There is no need to download any of the 
python file imports as they will be included.

The test file allows you to see all open windows. This is used to find the window names of particular applications so that they can be input into the master app list

To customize application opening, change the keywords in the tasks and appselect to fit your needs and then add the file locations to
the subprocess opener labelled sp.Popen.
